Currently I'm helping out with some school software called Candle. That takes most of my spare time, so I don't have lots of time for the things I used to. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜œ

That aside I'm crazy about code and trying to learn C++ and Assembler while my day job involves C#, (mostly) JavaScript, Html, CSS, Postgres, and... you know the rest.
